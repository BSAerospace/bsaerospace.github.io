                            <p style="color: #67647c;">BSA is committed to increasing the visibility of Black students and Black professionals in the aerospace and aviation industry. 
								As such, we support our members in their career endeavors and aspirations. During the school year, we offer professionally-neriching
								opportunities to our membership to prepare them for the real world. These include resume workshops, interview prep sessions, and
								in-person interactions with established companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Vayu Aerospace, to name a few.
								These efforts culminate in a membership body that is well-prepared for the workforce. <br></br>

								Below are highlights from our many members' summer employment experiences:</p>

                            <h3>Morghan Allen</a></h3>
                            <p style="color: #67647c;">I worked at Pfizer this summer at their site in Andover, MA (30 min outside of Boston) I spent the time working on two main projects. 
								The first was a manufacturing batch record comment tracker. I tracked over 300 comments in 120 batch records ensuring on time disposition of drug substance 
								using Microsoft planner and excel. The second project was process data analysis work. I performed an analysis on the production of two products: a hemophilia 
								B drug treatment and a bone morphogenetic protein. The analysis was to determine why people working in the manufacturing labs were unexpectedly working overtime.</p>

                            <p style="color: #67647c;">This summer, I interned at Northrop Grumman in Palmdale, CA, as a Structural Engineer, contributing to the B-21 Raider program, 
								one of the most advanced aircraft in the world. My primary responsibility involved analyzing non-conformances using MRB-specific tools, documents, and processes, 
								where I performed classical static strength analysis of primary and secondary structures to ensure they met structural integrity requirements. This work included 
								analyzing composite laminates, bolted joints, and composite joints. Additionally, I developed a tool to assist the MRB Stress team in reducing tag turn time, 
								ultimately helping to drive down the project budget.</p>

                            <p style="color: #67647c;">I spent the summer working in the University of Michigan Climate and Space Department on analyzing the performance of AWSoM, 
								a solar wind prediction tool developed by the University of Michigan, through changing specific parameters related to the development of coronal mass 
								ejections (CMEs). I ran various simulations on a supercomputer and recorded the results to later observe if any changes made the model more accurate.
								 She also created Python scripts to analyze the distances of simulated and observed solar wind properties and extreme ultraviolet images of the Sunâ€™s 
								 corona. At the end of the expereince, I presented her research to UMich faculty, staff, and students alike at the summer research showcase.</p>

                            <p style="color: #67647c;">This summer, I completed a Systems Engineering Internship at Honeywell Aerospace in Phoenix, Arizona. During this role I was
								 able to work on the HTF7000 engine control system. My main projects were to program a fault insertion unit for a virtual test bench and code a data 
								 analysis tool to clear metering valve and torque motor data before engines were shipped off to customers. Lastly, I worked on creating engine component 
								 logic diagrams for a virtual model of the engine that will be used for testing.</p>
