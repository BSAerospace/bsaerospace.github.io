							Our Mission
						</p>
						<p class="style3" style="color: #676c7a;">
							BSA is a student-run organization that is focused on creating a community and providing opportunities for marginalized 
							students interested in engineering, aerospace-related industries, and aviation.
							
							<br><br>
							
							Founded in 2020, we aim to create an academic and social community among those already pursuing a space-related education at UM, as well as to foster participation in the 
							industry for interested outsiders. We are accepting of everyone, and have quite a few members in disciplines outside of Aerospace 
							and even engineering in general!

							<br><br>
							
							We are committed to uplifting current Black Aerospace students, 
							as well as spotlighting the Black Aerospace professionals who have made it in the industry and serve as an inspiration to 
							those coming after them.

							<br><br>

							From our inception in February 2020, BSA has put on events that speak to the accomplishments of Black engineers and scientists. 
							We have also organized virtual panel discussions for members of the College of Engineering, featuring the voices and experiences 
							of Black students, professors, and alumni. BSA strives to initiate and facilitate positive dialogue between Black students and 
							the UM Aerospace Department, and we now work in conjunction with the College of Engineering’s Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) 
							committee to address issues that Black Aerospace students face at UM.

							<br><br>

							BSA works hard to ensure that Black students feel empowered and confident in their pursuit of an education in the aerospace industry. 
							Students of all majors are welcome to help us bring our vision to life!

									<h3><a href="events.html">Career Development</a></h3>
									<p>We aim to support students in their
										academic and professional pursuits. <br></br>
										We have partnered with our corporate
										sponsors to host events. Some of
										the companies that we have worked with in
										the past include Northrop Grumman, Blue
										Origin, Lockheed Martin, and Airbus. Last academic year, BSA raised over $30,000
										to send 23 members to 6 different
										conferences across the country. We are promoting and facilitating
										career development by fully funding our
										membership to attend.

									<h3><a href="events.html">Community Building</a></h3>
									<p>We aim to bolster the community
									of Black and underrepresented
									minorities on campus. <br></br>
									We held 16 community events last year, which
									spanned from game nights to driving down to
									Toledo to see the solar eclipse! These events
									are an opportunity to bond with old and newer
									members alike, and continue to cultivate the
									community that was initially formed by six
									friends. </p>

									<h3><a href="events.html">Outreach & Mentorship</a></h3>
									<p>We aim to improve the recruitment pipeline
										for underrepresented groups on campus
										through our outreach. <br></br>
										One way we have been accomplishing this is
										we’ve made an appearance at three larger
										outreach events, including one
										where 12 of our members went to a middle
										school in metro Detroit for full-day of
										outreach to present information about the
										upcoming solar eclipse and host an
										interactive activity. This year, we are
										grateful to have interacted with 500+ K-12
										students.</p>
